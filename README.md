What works (as of my initial commit):

* Players can move and jump with a controller
  * If you want to use a keyboard again, you'll have to go into the input manager and switch the axis inputs to keyboard/mouse
* The active player can be toggled with the Y button on an Xbox controller (triangle on ps4 assuming it goes by position?)
* If the active player is blue (player 1), they can jump on the blue (ice) blocks.  Similarly, orange (player 2) can jump on the orange (fire) blocks when they're active


## PlayerSwitching branch

This branch is for implementing the players 'riding' eachother and functionality for switching between who is top and who is bottom
